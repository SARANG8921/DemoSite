    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Mahabaleshwar (pronunciationⓘ) is a small town and a municipal council in Satara district, Maharashtra, India. It is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus because the Krishna River has its origin here.[1] The British colonial rulers developed the town as a hill station, and it served as the summer capital of the Bombay Presidency during the British Raj.</p>

    <p>Legend says that a Yadava ruler from 13th century built a small temple and water tank at the source of the river Krishna.[17] The Valley of Jawali, the area around Mahabaleshwar, was ruled by the More (clan) who were vassals of the Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. In 1656, the founder of Maratha empire, Chhatrapati Shivaji, killed the then ruler of Valley of Javali, Chandrarao More, and seized the area.[18][19] Around that time Shivaji also built a hill fort near Mahabaleshwar called Pratapgad fort</p>
